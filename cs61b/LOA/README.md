A command-line game simulating Lines of Action, a game invented by Claude Soucie. Lines of Action features command-line graphics and AI-opponents. 
This project was created for the University of California, Berkeley Spring 2020 CS 61B.

#### Main Task
Implemented the following command:
* new
* auto P
* manual P
* set CR P N
* dump
* seed N
* limit N
* help
* quit

Also implemented an AI that is able to find forced wins within a small number of moves
* A forced win in N moves is a situation in which one side can always win after making N moves with proper play, no matter what the opponent does.
The project was awarded with full credits including ECs.
