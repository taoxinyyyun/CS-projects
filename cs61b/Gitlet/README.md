## CS61B Gitlet

In this project, I implemented my own version control system that mimics certain functionalities of the popular Git. 
Done from scratch without starter code. Project 3 for CS61B - "Data Structures" at UC Berkeley during Spring 2020.

Project was completed using the IntelliJ Java IDE.

#### Functionality
* Implements the git commands init, add, commit, rm, log, global-log, find, status, checkout, branch, rm-branch, reset, merge, push, fetch, and pull.
