## Introduction

A collection of projects from the CS 61 series at UC Berkeley. The CS 61 series is an introduction to computer science, with particular emphasis on software and machines from a programmer's point of view. Both Java and Python are used.

### Table of Contents
#### 1. cs61b
>  Much of 61B will be concerned with the tradeoffs in time and memory for a variety of methods for structuring data. We'll also be concerned with the engineering knowledge and skills needed to build and maintain moderately large programs.

#### 2. cs61a
> In CS 61A, we are interested in teaching you about programming, not about how to use one particular programming language. We consider a series of techniques for controlling program complexity, such as functional programming, data abstraction, and object-oriented programming.
> Primarily use Python3 for language
