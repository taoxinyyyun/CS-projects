### CS 61A Intro
Projects are from CS 61A at UC Berkeley during [Fall 2019](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61a/fa19/).
CS 61A concentrates on the idea of abstraction, allowing the programmer to think in terms appropriate to the problem rather than in low-level operations dictated by the computer hardware.

Languages used:
* Python 3 (Primary language)
* SQL
* Scheme
