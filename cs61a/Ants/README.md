### CS61A Ants
The game Ants in Python 3. This is the Project 3 for CS61A - "Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs" at UC Berkeley during Fall 2019.

The code is based on skeleton code from the class. Project was completed using the Sublime Text. This submission received full score with extra credits.

> In this project, you will create a tower defense game called Ants Vs. SomeBees. As the ant queen, you populate your colony with the bravest ants you can muster. Your ants must protect their queen from the evil bees that invade your territory. Irritate the bees enough by throwing leaves at them, and they will be vanquished. Fail to pester the airborne intruders adequately, and your queen will succumb to the bees' wrath. This game is inspired by PopCap Games' Plants Vs. Zombies.

> This project combines functional and object-oriented programming paradigms, focusing on the material from Composing Programs. The project also involves understanding, extending, and testing a large program.
